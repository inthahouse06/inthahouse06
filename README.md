## Oh hey! 👋

I'm not sure how you found your way to my github profile but fancy to e-meet you!
I build digital things for a living out of Canada, Montreal. The 💰 I earn from these stuffs are used to refill my ever dwindling supply of coffee beans, maintain a fancy gym membership, and to funds some of my expensive hobbies which include trying my luck at the black jack table 🤣

If you enjoy BBQ 🥩🤤 or tv show dramas, feel free to connect on any of these platforms!!
